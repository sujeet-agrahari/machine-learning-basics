# Machine Learning

- Today, when refer to AI, it is most likely ML only
- AI is a huge set of tools to make computers behave intelligently
- ML is most important subset of AI

## What is ML?

A set of tools to making inferences and predictions from provided data

- Predict future events i.g.
  - Will it rain tomorrow? Yes (75% probability)
- Infer the causes of events and behaviors, it's more about drawing insights e.g.
  - Why does it rain?
- Infer patterns
  - Different types of weather conditions
    - Rainy, sunny etc.
- Inference helps to make predictions

## How does it work?

- It works with the help of statistics and computer science.
- It can learn without step by step instructions.
- It learns patterns from existing data and applies it to new data. i.g. analyzing the spammed emails, it will be able to detect whether an email is spam or not.
- It relies on high quality data

### What is use of Data Science?

Data science is about making discoveries and creating insights from data.

## ML Models

It's a statistical representation of a real-world process on data.

```
 [Cat Image] --> [Cat Detection Model] --> [Yes/No]

```

If we created a model based on traffic details with date wise,

```
[Future Date] --> [Traffic Prediction Model] --> [Traffic Conditions]
```

## Types of ML

1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Supervised Learning
3. Unsupervised Learning

- Training Data
  - existing data to learn from
- Training a Model
  - when a model is being built from training data

### Supervised Learning

After the model is trained on above data, we can make predicitons.
![Alt text](supervised-learning-2.png)

In supervised learning outcomes are known set of values i.e. for above it can either be true or false

### Unsupervised Learning

It doesn't have labels. It is only trained on features.
Usage:

- Anomaly detection
- Clustering or Grouping

![Alt text](unsupervised-learning.png)
In above, it categorized the data. One category could be high cholesterol and blood sugar in a certain age range.

![Alt text](unsupervised-learning-2.png)

In reality, data doesn't always come with labels.
It requires manual labour to label.
Label are unknown
No label means, model is unsupervised and finds its own patterns i.e. self driving cars.

## Machine Learning Workflow

![Alt text](workflow.png)

The above scenario is a example of supervised learning because we already have target label i.e. sale price

### Step 1

### Step 2

![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-09-13 at 10.38.56 AM.png>)

Dataset is split into train and test dataset.

### Step 3

### Step 4

If model doesn't perform better i.e. the predictions are not accurate. We need to tune it.

### Overall Workflow

### Summary of steps

1. Extract features
   - Choosing features and manipulating the dataset
2. Split dataset
   - Train and test dataset
3. Train model
   - Input train dataset into a machine learning model
4. Evaluate
   - If desired performance isnâ€™t reached: tune the model and repeat Step 3

## Supervised Learning

1. Classification
2. Regression

### Classification:

Assigning a category to an observation.

Examples:

- Will this custome stop the subscription? Yes/No
- Is this mole cancerous? Yes/No
- What kind of wine is this? Red/White/Rose
- What is this flower? Rose/Tulip/Lily

### Regression

Assigning a continuous variable

Examples:

- How much this stock be worth?
- What is this exoplanet's mass?
- How tall this child be as an adult?

### Classification Vs Regression

- Regression = continuous
  - Any value within a finite or infinite interval e.g 20F, 20.F
- Classification = category
  - One of few predefined values
    - Cold, Mild, Hot

## Unsupervised Learning

- Unsupervised learning = no target column
  - no guidance
- Looks at the whole dataset
- Tries to detect a pattern

1. Clustering
2. Anomaly Detection
3. Association

### Clustering

Groups the dataset based on their features

Clustering Models:

- K Means: needs to specify the number of clusters
- DBSCAN(density based spatial clustering of applications with noise): don't the number of clusters in advance rather it requires to specify what constitutes the cluster

### Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection = detecting outliers

outliers = observations that defer from the rest

Usecase:

- Discover devices that fail faster or last longer
- Discover fraudster that manage trick the system
- Discover patients that resist a fatal disease

### Association

Finding relationship between observations.

Events happen together

Usecase:

- Market, Basket analysis - which objects bought together
- People buying beer likely to buy peanuts

## Evaluation

Overfitting:

- performs great on training data
- performs poorly on testing data
- model memorized training data and can't generalize learnings to new data
- using testing data set to check performance

Accuracy = correctly classified observation / all observations

e.g 48 \* 100 / 50 = 96%

Limits of Accuracy: fraud example

- False Negative : Telling a pregnant women that you are not pregnant
- False Positive: Telling a man he is pregnant

Above is a bad score, we must consider optimizing it.
